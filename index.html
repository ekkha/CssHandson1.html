        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen ,paper or in other media</li>
        <li> <span class="con2">Css is not neccesary</span><span class="con3"> CSS saves a lot of work</span>. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        </li>

    <h2 class="sample">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <div class="con5">
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Inline -by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="con3">in this tutorial we
            will use inline and internal styles</span>,because this is eaiser to demonstrate, and casier for you to try it
            yourself.
        </li>

    </ul>
</div>

    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a styles to multiple elements . ID, on 
        the other hand ,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by
        JavaSricpt.

    <p>
       In  CSS selector are used to target a specific elements or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles
       can be applied to the element.

    <p>
       There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.both are used to target elements to which a style should 
        be applied.
